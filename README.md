# Can We Fix Our Dammed Rivers?

# Background
------

The first dam was built in California in 1770. Today there are over 1,500 dams in California alone and dams across the U.S. are responsible for more than 6% of the country's electric power. They are also responsible for altering the ecosystems they sit on in ways we still don't fully understand. 

In 1992, the EPA started implementing TMDLs to start improving water qualities. 28 years later there are still thousands of impaired water bodies across the state of California.


## Questions
- Do dammed rivers contain more pollutants than naural rivers?
- Are dammed rivers helped by the implementation of TMDLs?


# The Data
---------

## California Dams Data

The California dams data comes from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This dataset consists of 1576 dams in California that meet at least one of the following criteria:
- High hazard potential classification - loss of human life is likely if the dam fails,
- Significant hazard potential classification - no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or impact other concerns,
- Equal or exceed 25 feet in height and exceed 15 acre-feet in storage,
- Equal or exceed 50 acre-feet storage and exceed 6 feet in height.

The dataset documents over 50 different dam attributes, but I will only be using this data to cross reference dammed rivers with impaired rivers in California Impaired Waters Dataset, so the only important column here is, 'RIVER'.
