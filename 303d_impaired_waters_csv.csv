A TMDL was completed for the Laguna for ammonia and dissolved oxygen in 1995. The TMDL concluded that high ammonia levels in the Laguna were the result of point and non-point source nitrogen inputs of various forms. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations were a result of inputs of organic matter and nutrients which stimulate algal growth and subsequently cause depressed dissolved oxygen levels when the algae dies and decays. The TMDL took the form of a Waste Reduction Strategy (WRS) which addressed the reduction of nitrogen loading from point and non-point sources. With the implementation of the WRS and operational improvements at the City of Santa Rosa Waste Water Treatment Plant as well as improvements in waste storage and disposal activities at local dairies, nitrogen inputs to the Laguna were significantly reduced. Following implementation of the WRS and the subsequent attainment of nitrogen-ammonia interim concentration goals, as stated in the WRS, the Laguna was removed from the 303(d) List for ammonia and dissolved oxygen in 1998, pursuant to a recommendation by US EPA. However, dissolved oxygen levels in the Laguna continue to fall below the Regional Water Board Basin Plan minimum DO objective of 7.0 mg/L and in many cases fluctuate significantly on a daily and seasonal basis. Based on available information, it appears that phosphorus may contribute to the dissolved oxygen fluctuations. However, the cause of the low dissolved oxygen levels is not certain. While elevated phosphorus levels may contribute to low DO, nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, based on recent Laguna measurements, indicate that nitrogen may be the macronutrient controlling plant growth in the Laguna.
