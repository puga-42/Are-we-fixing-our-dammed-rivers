The affected water body, and associated pollutant or stressor, is then prioritized in the 303(d) List. The Clean Water Act further requires the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for each listing. In 2008, California began integrating the 303(d) List of Impaired Waters and the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment Report into a single report (Integrated Report). This Integrated Report will satisfy the requirements of both CWA Sections 303(d) and 305(b)."

A large portion of mercury impairment is the result of mine tailings leeching into reservoirs and becoming trapped in sediment. It then is deposited downstream when the reservoir turns over.
